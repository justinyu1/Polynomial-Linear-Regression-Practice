# Non-Linear-Regressions (position salaries)
Made a polynomial linear model to predict what a new employee's salary should be based on what their previous salary was. The new employee requested $160,000 for their new role as this is how much they made at their preveious job. I have created a polynomial model to predict how this person should actually make based on their years of experience. This is a truth or bluff detector that HR would use to verify and justify salary negotiations. 

Also experimented with SVR, Decision tree, and Random Forest regression models to fit the same dataset and predict the employee's salary.
