# Polynomial-Linear-Regression-Practice
Made a polynomial linear model to predict what a new employee's salary should be based on what their previous salary was. The new employee requested $160,000 for their new role as this is how much they made at their preveious job. I have created a polynomial model to predict how this person should actually make based on their years of experience. This is a truth or bluff detector that HR would use to verify and justify salary negotiations. 

Also experimented with SVR, Decision tree regression to fit the same dataset and predict.
